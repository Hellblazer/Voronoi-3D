A library for incrementally constructing 3 dimensional Delaunay tetrahedralizations.  The Voronoi network - the dual of the Delaunay - can be extracted from the system.  A graphical user interface for inspecting the voronoi/delaunay network is also provided.  

This library is licensed under the AGPL v3.0 and is built with Maven 2.x.  To build, cd into the root directory and do:

    mvn clean install
    
Depends on https://github.com/Hellblazer/Utils, so you'll have to check that out and make it until I get off my lazy ass and publish these in a maven repo
