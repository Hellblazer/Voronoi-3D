/**
 * An implementation of a spline interpolator for temporal interpolation that
 * tries to follow the specification referenced by:
 * http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL/animation.html#animationNS-OverviewSpline .
 * <p>
 * Basically, a cubic Bezier curve is created with start point (0,0) and
 * endpoint (1,1). The other two control points (px1, py1) and (px2, py2) are
 * given by the user, where px1, py1, px1, and px2 are all in the range [0,1]. A
 * property of this specially constrained Bezier curve is that it is strictly
 * monotonically increasing in both X and Y with t in range [0,1].
 * <p>
 * The interpolator works by giving it a value for X. It then finds what
 * parameter t would generate this X value for the curve. Then this t parameter
 * is applied to the curve to solve for Y. As X increases from 0 to 1, t also
 * increases from 0 to 1, and correspondingly Y increases from 0 to 1. The
 * X-to-Y mapping is not a function of path/curve length.
